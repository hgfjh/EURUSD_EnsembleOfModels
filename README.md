# EURUSD_EnsembleOfModels
In this project, we use XGBoost, KMeans, Hidden Markov Models, and a PPO Policy reinforcement learning agent to trade using 1 minute bid-only OHLC candle data on the EURUSD Forex pair. This only serves as a proof of concept as trading costs, market order book structure, and other complicating factors were not considered due to data limitations.

Feel free to contact me at oio3@cornell.edu with any questions or comments. I have a lot of ideas about how to improve this project and would love to chat about it.
