# EURUSD_EnsembleOfModels
In this project, we use XGBoost, KMeans, Hidden Markov Models, and a PPO Policy reinforcement learning agent to trade using 1 minute bid-only OHLC candle data on the EURUSD Forex pair. This only serves as a proof of concept as trading costs, market order book structure, and other complicating factors were not considered due to data limitations.
